# Chatbot Setup Instructions

Follow these simple steps to get the AI chatbot up and running.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

## Step 2: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the generated API key

## Step 3: Create .env File

Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project (same folder as `package.json`):

```bash
# Create the .env file (you can also copy from .env.example)
cp .env.example .env
```

## Step 4: Add Your API Key

Open the `.env` file and add your API key:

```
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with the API key you copied in Step 2.

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it! The chatbot should now be fully functional.
